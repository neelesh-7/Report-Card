                I would give myself a mark of 99% for this class, as I have consistently demonstrated strong communication, thinking, and application skills. Everyone else is going to talk about ‚Äòparticipating in discussions, handing in your work in a timely fashion, and helping their peers.‚Äô
<br>
However, I take this class seriously and spend time on assignments to finish them thoroughly. Teaching the class how negative numbers work in Binary and Hexadecimal (2 bonus marksüòè). Even though I wasn‚Äôt able to get my initial proposal topic, I am really passionate about the current topic I have chosen. During the couple of spare classes we have had, I have already finished my research (I was surprised with how long it took). According to my updated GANTT chart for my proposal, I am on track to be able to present at the end of May. I plan on making my own website as a demonstration for a software boot camp, and maybe even run a simulation on some of the possibilities that it can lead you to (pros and cons). I need to learn how to create this simulation to help me stand out from the rest of the presentations. Last week, for the <i>4 Push Button Arduino Motorized Car</i>, I had problems getting the motor to actually spin. I spent all of lunch looking at the circuit and with Mr. Chan‚Äôs help, we came to the conclusion that the circuit and code was perfect. Then what could be the problem? Well, the motors didn‚Äôt have enough power to move, so I connected the circuit to a 9V battery. However, for simplicity's sake, I replaced the motors with green (forward) and red (backward) lights to help show the visual. Even though it was just lab work, I spent hours on a small problem, but that‚Äôs what engineering is all about. My friends constantly make fun of me for putting so much effort into things that they spent 10 minutes on while also getting a 100%. 
<br>
Engineering has helped me realize that life is about being able to change your mind and opinion on things. Just like my ‚Äò06 Honda Accord, it is still running even after 295k km on it. I thought it was learning new things, but recently after experimenting with logic gates, my knowledge on the chips wasn‚Äôt enough. I tried more complex adder circuits which required much more thinking to understand what is happening from multiple perspectives. That‚Äôs what having a partner is about. Not only do you share the mark (50% - 50%), you also need to share ideas on how to tackle the problem. Sehbaj, my partner, has helped me understand Boolean algebra and think of it in a different way. However, Sehbaj also has to understand and accept that the Leafs aren‚Äôt going to win the Stanley Cup anytime soon.
